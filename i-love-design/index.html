                My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. I love to draw
                and all that is connected with the design. In this area a long time
                ago and during this time I managed to create several successful
                projects used by people all over the world.

                I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I see it,people,
                it's like my work. Naturally do not want to rest on our laurels and
                will continue further studies to improve soybean skills, creating
                new interesting creative projects.

                <h3>TEMPLATE.</h3>
                <p>
                    Lately, I often create templates for
                    WordPress. The portfolio is the
                    presentation and the opportunity to
                    buy them on the site Themeforest.

                <p>
                    Creating a brand is a very complex
                    process aimed at the creation and
                    positioning the unique persons of the
                    company, its products and services.

                <p>
                    Everyone is able to destroy the
                    dream, but not everyone is able to
                    create it. I try to help people in its
                    definition as a person and specialist.
